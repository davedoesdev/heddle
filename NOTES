Use ddpt to write heddle.img to disk since it supports sparse device writes:

ddpt if=heddle.img of=/dev/sdb bs=512 bpt=128 oflag=sparse

(man ddpt - if writing to SSD could use trim)



#TODO
test dobby extension


*** remember when documenting to ask users to add to ntp pool, with instructions

*** Weave, Fold and Salt should be done in dobby - still in an image but add 'extension'
- make a start by splitting weave off into dobby
add support to heddle so can easily supply extra packages from another project
(including adding prepare steps at runtime)
same for nfdhcpd, Fold
# nfdhcpd
# Fold - add dhcpcd -Z rules
# Saltstack (inc ota updates)
