Use ddpt to write heddle.img to disk since it supports sparse device writes:

ddpt if=heddle.img of=/dev/sdb bs=512 bpt=128 oflag=sparse

(man ddpt - if writing to SSD could use trim)



#TODO
# test on microserver
# support image updates
    make dist and update dirs
# upgrade to latest aboriginal linux - try compiling on its own first, see if pthread_once patch is required; can we deploy this in an update?


*** remember when documenting to ask users to add to ntp pool, with instructions

*** Weave and Salt should be done in dobby - still in an image but add 'extension'
- make a start by splitting weave off into dobby
support to heddle so can easily supply extra packages from another project
(including adding prepare steps at runtime)
same for nfdhcpd, Fold
# nfdhcpd
# Fold - add dhcpcd -Z rules
# Saltstack (inc ota updates)
