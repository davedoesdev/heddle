#TODO
# test on bare metal
#   Should work on usb stick too
# upgrade to latest aboriginal linux - try compiling on its own first, see if pthread_once patch is required
# support image updates


*** remember when documenting to ask users to add to ntp pool, with instructions

*** Weave and Salt should be done in dobby - still in an image but add 'extension'
- make a start by splitting weave off into dobby
support to heddle so can easily supply extra packages from another project
(including adding prepare steps at runtime)
same for nfdhcpd, Fold
# nfdhcpd
# Fold - add dhcpcd -Z rules
# Saltstack (inc ota updates)
