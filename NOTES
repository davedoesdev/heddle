#TODO
# pip (above)?
# test on bare metal
#   Should work on usb stick too (could drive with -usbdevice disk:foo.img -boot menu=on)
# support image updates

# nfdhcpd
# kvm
# capstan
# Fold - add dhcpcd -Z rules
# Saltstack (inc ota updates)

*** change pool to heddle.pool.ntp.org and remember when documenting to ask users to add to pool, with instructions

*** Weave and Salt should be done in dobby - still in an image but add 'extension'
support to heddle so can easily supply extra packages from another project
(including adding prepare steps at runtime)
same with nfdhcpd, Fold?
